### Project Overview

This project is a pixel painting tool designed for creating 2D images. Users can select their desired grid, paint on it, and then export their work as either a PNG or JPEG image. This project marks my first experience with the Three.js library. Additionally, I created a 3D palette model in Blender for the very first time and positioned it in the hero section.
